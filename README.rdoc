= JqGridRails

Providing easy ways to build grids within Rails

== About

JqGridRails is a helper plugin to build grids using {jqGrid}[http://www.trirand.com/blog/]. It provides a number of features to allow a minimal amount of effort to build grids. However, it is also built with the maximum amount of flexibility in mind. As such, it provides easy access to all the capabilities jqGrid has to offer and allows the application to choose how much support is automatically provided.
